## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.7 or later
   - PyTorch or TensorFlow
   - Internet connection for downloading models

3. **Running Examples**
   - Navigate to any directory
   - Read the directory's README.md
   - Run the Python scripts

## Best Practices
- Always check GPU memory requirements
- Use appropriate batch sizes for your hardware
- Consider using smaller models for experimentation
