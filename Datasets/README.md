# Hugging Face Datasets Examples

This directory contains Python scripts demonstrating how to work with the Hugging Face Datasets library. Below is a brief overview of each script:

## dataset1.py
- **Task**: Dataset Loading and Processing
- **Description**: Demonstrates how to:
  - Load datasets from the Hugging Face Hub
  - Explore dataset contents and structure
  - Preprocess data with tokenizers
  - Save and load datasets locally
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Dataset loading
  - Data preprocessing
  - Batch processing
  - Dataset statistics
  - Local dataset management

## Working with Datasets
1. **Loading**: Access thousands of public datasets
2. **Exploration**: Examine dataset structure and contents
3. **Preprocessing**: Transform data for model input
4. **Batching**: Efficient processing of large datasets
5. **Storage**: Save and load datasets locally

## Common Operations
- Dataset splitting
- Data shuffling
- Feature selection
- Mapping transformations
- Caching processed data
